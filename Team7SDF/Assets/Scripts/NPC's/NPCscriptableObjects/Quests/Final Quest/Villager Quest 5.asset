  questTitle: Villager 5 - New Resources
  questDescription: I've heard rumours about these really beautiful resources that
    are only available in the 75th  system and I really would love to use it for
    my food business! Is there a way that you could find access to this beautiful
    fruit? Would really help us advance our taste buds and understanding of culture!
