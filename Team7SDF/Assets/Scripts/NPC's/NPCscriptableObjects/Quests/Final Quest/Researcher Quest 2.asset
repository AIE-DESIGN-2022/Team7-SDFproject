  questTitle: Researcher 2 - New Fuel Site
  questDescription: I've got some interesting news about a new site that we have
    located!  We believe that this new location could be an ancient ruin that can
    potentially expand our incoming assets!  However, because this is a big scientific
    discovery, we do require a decent donation to research further.  Would you be
    able to assist in funding this revolutionary discovery?
