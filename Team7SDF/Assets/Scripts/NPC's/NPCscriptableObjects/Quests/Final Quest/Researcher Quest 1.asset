  questDescription: "\"Hello\u2026I am one of the key researchers in the western
    part of our illustrious planet!  And although our research is growing and expanding,
    we do request more funding to gather equipment  that can further understand new
    resources located on our excavation sites and build them into equipment  for
    our military forces.  This could potentially benefit both our defences and our
    growing expansion of resources for our economic influence!"
