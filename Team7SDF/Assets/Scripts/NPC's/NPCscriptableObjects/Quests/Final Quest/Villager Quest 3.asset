  questTitle: Villager 3 - More Jobs
  questDescription: Your majesty! We hope that you are staying well up here. We just
    wanted to ask that there be more jobs available  throughout the planet. Cost
    for certain resources have increased obviously but a lot of us can't afford to
    live  comfortably and are starving ourselves and our families! These jobs would
    really help us grow economically and  socially as well! Can you help us?
