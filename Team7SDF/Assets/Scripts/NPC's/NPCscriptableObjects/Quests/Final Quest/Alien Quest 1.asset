  questTitle: Alien 1 - Marriage
  questDescription: "\"Well, well, well\u2026We notice that your home planet is in
    dire need of galactic assistance and reach in this  growing uprising that is
    sweeping the surrounding systems. With other planets threatening war and destruction, 
    it is crucial that our systems combine forces and resources to further protect
    ourselves and maybe our people.  The way that we propose is a joint unification
    through marriage.  You would simply just commit your life to one of my heirs
    and in return, we share resources in both valuables  and in military support!
    Will you accept our proposal?"
