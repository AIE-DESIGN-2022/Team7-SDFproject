  questDescription: If it isn't the somewhat most respected ruler in this sector
    of the galaxy! As I understand it, there is an ever growing  threat that endangers
    not only your people and planet, but your rule! All that I simply request is
    that we join our  forces so that in the case of them threatening either one of
    us or our planets, we protect one another!  What do you say?
