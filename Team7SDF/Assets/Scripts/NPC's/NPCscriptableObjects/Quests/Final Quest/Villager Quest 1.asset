  questTitle: Villager 1 - Lower Taxes
  questDescription: "I-I-I'm so sorry to ask this of you, most generous one\u2026but
    down on the main planet, we are struggling to keep our  finances and credit ratings
    up. We understand the economic structure that you have so brilliantly put into
    place,  but we are struggling to even pay for basic food and resources! Lowing
    the taxes on such items would really help  so many families in need."
