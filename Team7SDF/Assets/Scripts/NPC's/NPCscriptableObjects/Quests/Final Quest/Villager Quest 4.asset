  questTitle: Villager 4 - Form Military Force
  questDescription: Sorry to barge in like this but we've heard news about several
    other systems rallying together and targeting  systems and planet close to us!
    We need to up our defences and act if we want to stand a chance against these
    fools!  I'd like to ask that you bring forth a military force that volunteers
    can sign up to.  I'd be proud to fight for my planet and keep my friends and
    family safe. Will you please help protect our beautiful  home?
